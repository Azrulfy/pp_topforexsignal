            The hypothetical performance results displayed on this website are results in that they represent trades made in the traders account. Transaction prices were determined by assuming that buyers received the ask price and sellers the bid price of quotes top forex signal receives from the Forex broker at which a Signal Provider maintains a demo account. The hypothetical results do not include any additional mark-ups or commissions which may be charged by a customer’s Forex broker and are based on a one lot trade size. The number of pips gained or lost by each Signal Provider may be based on the trading of mini, micro or standard lots. The performance of customers electing to trade a different lot size from those used by a Signal Provider will therefore vary. Further, customers may place trades independent of those provided by a Signal Provider or place customized orders to exit positions which differ from those of a Signal Provider. All performance results presented only include the results of completed trades and do not reflect the profit or loss on open positions. Due to differences in the bid/ask offered by various counterparties, all trades executed in the account of a Signal Provider may not be executed in a customer account if the bid/ask of the Forex broker at which the customer maintains the customer’s account is different from that of the Signal Provider’s broker or due to volatility in the market. Customers may elect not to follow all of the trading signals provided by the signal providers or be able trade the recommended number of contracts due to insufficient funds in an account. Therefore, the results portrayed are not indicative of an account which may have traded all a Signal Provider’s signals or contracts. Further, by electing to follow a number of different Signal Providers at one time, customers may not be able to follow all of the signals generated due to the customer’s account having insufficient funds. Accordingly, the performance of customer accounts may vary significantly from the results portrayed on this website.

            HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

            [3] Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Note that the accounts represented may not follow all of the trading signals provided by the signal providers or trade the recommended number of contracts. Therefore, the results portrayed are not indicative of an account which may have traded all the recommended signals or contract of the providers. The number of signal providers followed by these accounts may also vary. Accordingly, performance results may vary substantially from account to account, depending on the number of signals and contracts traded and signal providers followed.

            [4] THIS COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE RECORD IS HYPOTHETICAL AND THESE TRADING ADVISORS HAVE NOT TRADED TOGETHER IN THE MANNER SHOWN IN THE COMPOSITE. HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY MULTI-ADVISOR MANAGED ACCOUNT OR POOL WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE A COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE RECORD SIMILAR TO THAT SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A HYPOTHETICAL COMPOSITE RECORD AND THE ACTUAL RECORD SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF A HYPOTHETICAL COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE RECORD IS THAT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE SELECTION OF TRADING ADVISORS AND THE ALLOCATION OF ASSETS AMONG THOSE TRADING ADVISORS WERE MADE WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT BASED UPON THE HISTORICAL RATES OF RETURN OF THE SELECTED TRADING ADVISORS. THEREFORE COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE RECORDS INVARIABLY SHOW POSITIVE RATES OF RETURN. ANOTHER INHERENT LIMITATION ON THESE RESULTS IS THAT THE ALLOCATION DECISIONS REFLECTED IN THE PERFORMANCE RECORD WERE NOT MADE UNDER ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEREFORE, CANNOT COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE RECORD MAY BE DISTORTED BECAUSE THE ALLOCATION OF ASSETS CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPOSITE.
