Top Forex Signal is a web front-end to trade copying bots. I developed the front end and as well as the data pipeline for the backend which leveraged simple APIs from Forex data providers.

I developed the front-end with HTML5, CSS, JS, JQuery, and the D3 charting library. The backend was done with PHP extracting the data from a 3rd-party API and data IO done with MySQL.

Live app and servers no longer maintained.
